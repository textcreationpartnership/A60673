            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58589:7"/>are diſpoſed to ſeveral Offices for the preſervation of the whole; ſo in the Body Politick, a Diſtinction of perſons is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted neceſſary for the preſervation of the whole; and ſuch is the Policy of this Realm (eſpecially,) that for the better Government thereof, they have made a threefold Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> Sovereign, Nobles, and Commons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The King is our Sovereign Monarch, under which name a Sovereign Queen is comprehended.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Under the Name of Nobles are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the Prince, Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts, and Barons, called Lords Spiritual and Temporal.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By the Commons are underſtood the Knights of the Garter, (if no otherwiſe dignified,) Knights Bannerets, Baronets, Knights of the Bath, Knights Bachelours, Eſquires, and Gentlemen, together with Yeomen, Artificers, and Labourers.</p>
                     <p>And though our Law doth not call any man Noble under the Degree of a Baron, yet many there be which make a Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between <hi>Nobiles Majores,</hi> which is from the Prince to the Baron, and <hi>Nobiles Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> which includes all from under a Baron to the Gentleman, and leaves the reſt to be called Commons.</p>
                     <p>When we ſay the Nobles of the Land, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58589:7"/>King is not comprehended by the Common Law, he being the Fountain of all Nobility; but is by the Civil Law.</p>
                     <p>The Nobility are known by the name of the Peers of the Realm, or Barons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for anciently the Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, and Viſcounts, did ſit together in the King's great Counſel of Parliament, as Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, by which is underſtood the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Nobility; and though there be different Robes worn at their Creation, yet in Parliament the greateſt of the Nobility wear the ſame Robes with Barons, only the Dukes, Marqueſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wear more or leſs Furrs upon their Shoulders, with ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Furr, that is ſet as Fringes, or Edgings on their Robes, and take place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Dignity; of which more particularly anon.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, it is obſervable, that in Caſes cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, all Degrees of Nobility are tryed by Barons, as well as thoſe of their own Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Degree, as their Peers, and Barons are tryed by Nobles of a higher Degree: as well, as thoſe of their own, as in all ſuch Caſes is well known.</p>
                     <p>It may be here noted, That no Engliſh man receiving any Title of Honour from a foreign Prince, can uſe the ſame in <hi>England,</hi> But (if he have no other Title from the King) muſt in all judicial proceedings be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58589:8"/>named by his name of Baptiſm, and Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name; excepting only the Honour of Knight-hood which is to be born in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And this is the ſame in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as well as in other Lands.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58589:11"/>Princes of ſome Countries are called Dukes, as of <hi>Moſcovoy, Savoy, Florence, Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony, &amp;c.</hi> At their Creation they have two Enſigns of Honour (and ſo have moſt other Noble men) to ſignifie their Duty. Firſt, their Heads are adorned with a Chapeau, or Head Attire of Scarlet Colour, doubled or lined with Ermin: And, Secondly a Sword, which is girt about him, which ſhews his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to ſerve and defend his Prince; his Mantle over his ſhoulders is guarded with four guards or Folds of Ermin; his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net is of Gold, ſet round with Leaves; the Cap is of Crimſon (but not indented as the Prince's is, unleſs he be of the Bloud Royal,) and his Verge is of Gold: Dukes of the Bloud Royal have their Coronet's compoſed of Croſſes, and Flower de-luces, and are repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Arch-Dukes.</p>
                     <p>A Duke <hi>tantum</hi> (or no more but Duke) takes place before Marqueſs, and Earl; but if a Duke be Marqueſs, and Earl, or either of them, then he ſhall take place before ſuch Duke <hi>tantum.</hi> Note; Dukes, Marqueſſes, and Earls, at their Creation are girt with a Sword, (or elſe it is put over their Shoulders) which Viſcounts, and Barons, have not.</p>
                     <p>A Duke out of the King's or Prince's preſence, may have a Cloth of State han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging down within half a yard of the Ground; his Ducheſs may have the ſame, and her
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58589:12"/>Train born up by a Baroneſs. No Earl, without Permiſſion, ought to waſh with a Duke.</p>
                     <p>Dukes Eldeſt Sons, by the Courteſie of <hi>England,</hi> are from their Birth ſtyled Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes, (and the younger Sons Lords,) and and take place of Viſcounts, but not ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileg'd by the Laws of the Land. A Duke hath the Title of Grace; being written un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, he is ſtyled Moſt High, Moſt Noble, and Potent Prince; alſo Right Noble. Dukes of the Bloud are ſtyled, Moſt High, Moſt Mighty, and Illuſtrious Princes.</p>
                     <p>The Ceremonies at his Creation are theſe: He hath his Sur-coat and Hood, and is led between two of the Nobleſt Perſons preſent, not being above him; a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him on the Right-hand goeth an Earl with the Cap of State, and Coronet on it; on the other ſide an Earl with the Verge: Juſt before him one of the greateſt Eſtate (as Marqueſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) bearing his Sword, and before him an Earl bearing his Mantle, and Robe of State; all which Nobles muſt be in their Robes. His Title is proclaimed twice, and <hi>Largus</hi> thrice: His Honour is Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, (as is all the Nobles, unleſs otherwiſe Provided in their Patent, which is rare.) Laſtly, a Duke may conſtitute ſix Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains.</p>

                     <p>At his Creation he muſt have his Surcoat and Hood: He is led by Marqueſſes, his Sword, Cap, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are born by Earls.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe next and loweſt Degree of Nobility, is that of a Baron, which is twofold, Lords Spiritual, and Temporal; but firſt of the Lords Spiritual, or Biſhops.</p>
                     <p>§ 1. By Lords Spiritual are meant on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Suffragan Biſhops, for the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are accounted of the prime Nobility of the Kingdom, of which we have two, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>York.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had formerly great Honour; ſo that no Legate, or <hi>Nuntio</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> could exerciſe any Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantine Power, without the King's ſpecial
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58589:14"/>Licenſe; elſe he was accountable to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> In General Councils he had place before all Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, at the Pope's right Foot, and at home was reputed the ſecond Perſon in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or firſt Peer of the Realm, having Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of all Dukes, (not of the Royal Bloud) and of all the great Officers of State. He hath Power to ſummon the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and the Biſhops of his Province to a National Synod: He is ſtyled (even by the King) <hi>by the Grace of God,</hi> and writes himſelf <hi>by Divine Providence,</hi> as doth the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> (whereas other Biſhops write <hi>by Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion:</hi>) He hath the Title of Grace given him, as Dukes have, and of moſt Reverend Father in God, and Metropolitan of all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The Coronation of the King hath anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently belonged to him, it being reſolved that whereſoever the Court was, the King and Queen were the proper and Domeſtical Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioners of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> is accounted his Provincial, the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> his Chancellour, and the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> his Chaplain: He hath under his Juriſdiction twenty one Suffragan Biſhops, ſeventeen in <hi>England,</hi> and four in <hi>Wales:</hi> His Clergies Tenths are 65.1 <hi>l.</hi>—18 <hi>s.</hi> —2¼ <hi>d.</hi>— his Archbiſhoprick is valued in the King's Book at 2816 <hi>l.</hi>—17 <hi>s.</hi>—9¼<hi>d.</hi> He may qualifie and retain eight Chaplains,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58589:15"/>which is two more than a Duke may.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> pretended anciently to have all the Biſhops of <hi>Scotland</hi> under his Inſpection, and that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Conſecration from him, and ſwear Canonical Obedience to his See; (he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to write himſelf Metropolitan of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but not of All <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Canterbury</hi> doth;) but at length the Biſhops of <hi>Scotland</hi> would not acknowlege any ſuch Power to him, and diſowned all Obedience to him, and had Archbiſhops of their own, <hi>Anno</hi> 1466. leaving him in <hi>England</hi> but four Biſhops: His Biſhoprick is now valued at 1609 <hi>l.</hi> —19<hi>s.</hi>—2<hi>d.</hi> And the Tenths of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to 1113 <hi>l.</hi>—17 <hi>s.</hi>—9 <hi>d.</hi> 10 <hi>b.</hi> 1. <hi>qu.</hi> he hath Precedency before all Dukes not of the Royal Bloud, and before all great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of State, except the Lord Chancellour, or Lord Keeper. He hath the Title of Grace, and moſt Reverend Father in God; and he writeth <hi>by Divine Providence:</hi> He hath the Honour to crown the Queen, and to be her perpetual Chaplain, and hath great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, only <hi>Durham</hi> hath a peculiar Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, exempt from the See of <hi>York.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having made this Digreſſion, we come next to ſpeak of the Suffragan Biſhops, who though they have ſome peculiar Precedencies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, yet in general they are eſteemed as Barons, and from thence have
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58589:15"/>the names of Lords Spiritual. In their own Courts they have power to judge, and paſs Sentence alone; and therefore they ſend forth their Writs in their own name, and not in the King's: In whatever Princes Dominions they are, their Epiſcopal Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Degree is owned: In Parliament they Vote in all things, except in matter of Life and Limb. They have the Title of Lord, are ſtyled Right Reverend Fathers in God, and write <hi>by Divine Permiſſion:</hi> They may qualifie 6 Chaplains (which are as many as a Duke,) and are Barons and Peers of the Realm: And as Spiritual Barons precede all under the Degree of a Viſcount, and are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the King's Right Hand in Parliament. All Church-men are prohibited the wearing of Swords, and a Prieſt the Order of Knighthood.</p>
                     <p>§ 2. Of Barons Temporal. We may obſerve that the word Baron is variouſly derived; ſome from the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, ſome from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> which is the ſame with <hi>Vir</hi> in Latine, and with <hi>Varon</hi> in the Spaniſh; ſo that Baron ſignifies a notable or principal man; thus anciently the Burgeſſes of <hi>London</hi> were called Barons, as thoſe of the Cinque-Ports now are: but leaving the Name to ſpeak of the Perſon, a Baron (the Archbiſhops excepted) is a Dignity next to a Viſcount, and though, according to <hi>Cambden,</hi> they are not by our Common Laws allowed to be of the Degree
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58589:16"/>of Nobility, yet this of a Baron may be by Tenure; for the Title of Baron by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (which is under the Broad-Seal of <hi>England</hi>) is <hi>Status, Gradus, Dignitas,</hi> and being by the King's Writ ſummoned as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the higher Houſe of Parliament, they are thereby made Nobles and Peers of the Realm. As they are Barons, without any other Diſtinction, they wear a Coronet, (by the Ordinance of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d.) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſix Balls or Pearls ſet cloſe to the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at equal diſtance, and have their peculiar Parliament Robes, which have two doublings of white Furr.

                     <p n="2">2. The Queen-Conſort: She hath very great Privileges, and the Laws ſet ſo high a value on her, as to make it High Treaſon to conſpire her Death, or violate her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58589:16"/>her Robes are the ſame with a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Queen: She ſits in State by the King, keeps her Court, and hath the ſame General Officers as the King hath; though ſhe be an Alien, ſhe needs no Act of Parliament to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralize her, the Crown taking away that defect: She hath the ſame Honour perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to her that the King hath, as well from Foreigners as Subjects.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Queen-Dowager: She hath the ſame Honour done to her alſo, and takes place next the Queen-Conſort; nor doth ſhe loſe her Title of Queen, though ſhe marry a private Gentleman, as Queen <hi>Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> Widow to <hi>Henry</hi> the 5th. who, though ſhe married <hi>Owen Tudor,</hi> Eſq; yet ſhe maintained her Action at Law, as Queen of <hi>England:</hi> So in King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th's Time Sir <hi>Thomas Seymer,</hi> Lord high Admiral, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving married the Queen <hi>Dowager</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. ſhe denied Precedency to her Siſter in Law, the Lord Protectour's Wife, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to her as Queen, which was aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſo high, that it proved the untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deaths of thoſe two famous Men.</p>
                     <p>The King's Daughters are all Princeſſes; the Eldeſt is called the Princeſs Royal, and her Royal Highneſs.</p>
                     <p>All Noble Mens, Baronets, and all Knights Wives are in Writings called Dames, (whence comes the name Madam.) Eſquires
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58589:17"/>and Gentlemens Wives are called Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women.</p>
                     <p>Noble Women are ſo either by Deſcent, Creation, or Marriage; all which ſhall remain Noble, although they marry under their Degree.</p>
                     <p>If a Gentleman, or a Peer, marry a Wife of ignoble Birth, ſhe ſhall enjoy the Title and Dignity of her Husband all her Life; but it is by the Courteſie, not by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> to give it her after her Husband's Death.</p>
                     <p>If a Woman of Bloud marry a mean Perſon, he is not at all advanced, but ſhe ſhall retain her own Honour; and if ſhe be an Heireſs, and have a Child by ſuch ignoble Perſon her Son may bear her Coat Armour; but this is diſputed by many, and denied by ſome, yet there are Examples of it, but are too long to recite here.</p>
                     <p>An Alien Woman married to a Peer, can have no privilege by her Husband, unleſs ſhe be naturalized.</p>
                     <p>The King may create any Woman to any Title of Honour by Letters Patents to them and their Heirs, which Heirs ſhall enjoy all the Titles and Honours due to their Mothers; as, if ſhe be a Ducheſs, he ſhall be a Duke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and many Men have claimed Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Honour and Dignity in Right of the Wives, by marrying the Sole Heireſs of a

                     <p>They are uſually made at the Coronation of a King or Queen, and at the Creation of a Prince, or Duke of the Royal Bloud; as at the Creation of <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>York: Theſe Knights</hi> ſaith <hi>Froyſard,</hi> as quoted by <hi>Bloom, were firſt created in</hi> Anno. 1399. but <hi>Elias Aſhmole</hi> Eſq; thinks them more ancient, and that <hi>Henry</hi> IV. who was then King, did not conſtitute, but rather reſtore the ancient manner of making Knights, and made it peculiar to the Knights of the Bath, which hath continued ſo ever ſince. They are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58589:23"/>aſſigned no Statues; neither are they to wear their Robes but upon the time of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, except a red Ribbon worn croſs their left Shoulder, (as thoſe of the Garter do a Blew,) with a Medal above mentioned; and upon a Vacancy, their number (which is uncertain) is not ſupplied. They are created with many and Noble Ceremonies, and have had Princes, and the prime of the Nobility of their Order. The principal Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are theſe:</p>
                     <p>The Perſon is firſt ſent for by the King, (and at his coming to Court, the King uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Knights him with the Sword of State,) where he is honourably received by the chief Officers and Nobles of the Court, and hath two Eſquires to wait upon him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey him to the Chamber appointed, (and ſee him no more that day,) where he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with Muſick; then a Bath is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by a Barber, who is to trim him, and then the King is informed that he is ready for the Bath; then is he inſtructed by the moſt grave Knights in the Order and Fees of Chivalry, the Muſick all the while playing at the Door; then they undreſs him and put him naked into the Bath, at which time the Muſick ceaſes, and one of the grave Knights ſaith to him, <hi>Be this an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Bath to thee.</hi> From the Bath he is conveyed to his Bed, which is plain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58589:23"/>Curtains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ſoon as he is dry they ſhall help to dreſs him, putting over his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Garment a Ruſſet Robe with long Sleeves, and an Hood like an Hermits; the Barber the mean while takes away the Bath, which, with all that belongs to it, and the Collar about his Neck, is his fees. He is then conducted to the Chapel with Muſick, where being entered, the Knights and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſhall be entertained with Wine, and Spices, and take their leave; then the Prieſt and the two Eſquires, with the new Knight, perform a vigil till almoſt day, with Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Offerings, beſeeching God (and his Bleſſed Mother) to make him worthy of that Dignity; and being confeſſed, he ſhall hold a Taper in his hand untill the reading of the Goſpel, at which time the ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Hood to one of the Eſquire, and the Taper to the other Eſquire, and a Penny muſt be laid on the Altar, on or near the Candleſtick; and when the prieſt comes to the Words <hi>Verbum caro factum eſt,</hi> he, while Kneeling, ſhall take the Taper and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to God, and the Penny to him who is to make him a Knight: Prayers done, he is conducted to his Chamber for ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, untill the King's Pleaſure be known, then being dreſſed he is led into the Hall, being girt with a Girdle of white Leather without Buckles, a Coif upon his Head, a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58589:24"/>Mantle of Silk over a Kirtle of Tartarin, tyed with a lace of white Silk, and a pair of white Gloves hanging at the end of the Lace; (all which is the Chandlers Fees) then mounting on horſe back, the grave Knights conduct him up the Hall to the King (with his Sword, and his Spurs hanging at the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil, carried before him) where the Marſhal and the Uſher meeting him, deſire him to allight, and the Marſhal ſhall take his Horſe for his Fee; being brought to the ſecond Table, with his Sword and Spurs held up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right before him, the King asks for the Sword and Spurs, which being ſhewed by the Chamberlain, the King takes the right Spur and gives it to the moſt Noble Perſon there, and wills him to put it on the Perſon's heel, and the Knight himſelf puts on the other, then the King taking the Sword, girds it about him, and puting his Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Neck; ſaith, <hi>Be thou a good Knight, and kiſſeth him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Knight thus made, is conducted back to the Chapel, where kneeling, with his right hand laid upon the high Altar, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to defend the rights of the Holy Church untill his Death, and ungirding his Sword he offereth it to God: At his going out the King's Maſter-Cook ſtands ready with his Carving knife in his hand; Saying, <hi>I the King's Maſter-Cook am come to receive
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58589:24"/>thy Spurs for my Fees; and if you do any thing contrary to the Honour of Knight-hood, (which God forbid) I ſhall hack your Spurs from your heels.</hi> Then the Knight is conducted into the Hall, where he ſits at Table with the Knights that are there, and riſing again, he retires into his Chamber, where his Robes are taken off, and he is cloathed in a Blew Robe, having a Lace of white Silk upon his left Shouldier, which ought to be worn upon all his Garments, untill he hath gained ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown in feats of Arms; or elſe ſome Princeſs or great Lady cut it from his Shoulder. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner he is conducted by the Knights into the King's Preſence, to return him thanks for theſe Honours; and taking his leave, with craving Pardon for any miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he is diſmiſt by the Title of Knight of the <hi>Bath.</hi>

No man can be born a Knight, but it is an Honour conferred on them by the Prince, either to encourage them to his Service, or as a reward for Service done, chiefly for his Valour in Battel; and he keeps his Title in all Countries where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he cometh, contrary to all other Degrees of Honour.</p>
                     <p>In Ancient time the manner of making or dubbing of a Knight was with great Honour, as in King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s time we find it thus: The King commanded a large Stage to be erected in, or near ſome Cathedral Church, and thereon was ſet a Chair of Silver, covered with Green Silk, in which the Perſon to be Knighted was placed; then he was deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded whether he was of a healthy Body, and able to undergo the Travel required in a Soldier, alſo whether he were a man of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Converſation, and what credible Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes he can produce to affirm the ſame: Then the Biſhop or other Chief Prelate took the Bible, and holding it open before the Knight,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58589:25"/>in Preſence of the King, and all others, ſpake theſe words:</p>
                     <p>Sir, <hi>You that deſire to receive the Order of Knight-hood, ſhall ſwear before God, and on this Holy Book, that you ſhall not fight against this Mighty and Excellent Prince, that now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth the Order of Knight-hood upon you, unleſs you ſhall be commanded ſo to doe in the Service of your own King, for in that Caſe having firſt yielded up the Collar, Device, and other Enſigns of Honour now received, it ſhall be lawfull for you to ſerve againſt him without Reproach or Offence to all other Companions in Arms; but otherwiſe doing, you ſhall incur In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, and being taken in War, ſhall be ſubject to the pains of Death. You ſhall alſo ſwear, with all your Force and Power to maintain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all Ladies, Gentlewomen, Orphans, and diſtreſſed Women. And you ſhall ſhun no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of your Perſon in any War wherein you ſhall happen to be.</hi> This Oath being taken, two of the chief Lords led him to the King, who drew forth his Sword, and laid it upon his Head, ſaying, <hi>God and St.</hi> George (or any other Saint whom he pleaſeth, but commonly St. <hi>George,</hi>) <hi>make thee a good Knight.</hi> Then came Seven Noble Ladies in white, and girded on his Sword, and four Honourable Knights put on his Spurs: Then the Queen (if there) took him by the right Arm, and a Ducheſs or greateſt Lady by the left, who led him to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58589:26"/>a ſeat, having three Aſcents, and there ſeated him; the King ſiting on his Right hand, and the Queen on his Left, the Lords and Ladies ſiting on the three Steps under the King and Queen; where being entertain'd with a Noble Banquet, the Ceremony's ended.</p>

                     <p>KNighthood is a Dignity, but Eſquire is a name of Worſhip, and in old time every Knight had two Eſquires to attend him, who bore his Armour, and kept allways cloſe to him: They held certain Lands of him in Eſcuage, as the Knight did of the King by Knight's Service; but now Eſquires are divided into five Ranks: The firſt, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58589:46"/>principal, are the eldeſt Sons of Viſcounts and Lords: The Second, all other Noble-men's younger Sons, with the eldeſt Sons of Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and Knights: The Third, are thoſe that are Select Eſquires of the King's Body: The Fourth, thoſe to whom the King giveth the Title to, (or createth Eſquires by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Silver Collar of S. S. about their Necks; and in former times they had a pair of Silver Spurs put to their Heels, thereby diſtinguiſhing them from Knights, who had the guilt Spur;) and to the firſt born Sons of theſe only doth the Title deſcend; they are now the Eſquires that attend the Knights of the Bath: The fifth and laſt, be thoſe that have any Superiour publick Office in the Kingdom; as High Sheriff, Juſtice of the Peace, Collonels, Lieutenant Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, Majors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or ſuch as ſerve the King in any worſhipfull Calling: But ſuch as are Eſquires, or Gentlemen by pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce only, when they loſe their Place, they alſo loſe their Title.</p>

                     <p>THis Title is of ſuch account, (as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,) that it is a general Name, even from the Sovereign to the meaneſt Perſon who either bears Coat-Armour, or is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſome eminent Office in Church or State; and many there be, who having by Providence roſe from a mean condition, and obſcure original, to poſſeſs large Demeans, have vain-gloriouſly uſurped the Title of Gentleman to themſelves; and ſo impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (I might have ſaid impudent) have ſome been, that becauſe their Sir-name have bordered upon the Sir-names of ſome Perſon of worth, they have laid down their own paternal Names, and aſſumed the Names of thoſe Gentlemen ſo near to theirs, and born their Coat-Armour, and in time have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be of the ſame Family.</p>
                     <p>Some derive the Name Gentleman as a Compound, partly from the French word <hi>Gentile,</hi> that is, one born of honeſt Parents, to which the Saxon Word <hi>Man</hi> is joyned, and ſo make it Gentleman, which may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a man well born, and under that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58589:47"/>Name are all comprehended that are above Yeomen, Merchants, or Artificers, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Saxons</hi> called them <hi>Edelmen,</hi> or Noble Men. Which ſhews that Gentlemen take their beginning from ſomething that they have done (in War or Peace,) for which the King (who is the Fountain of Honour) doth think them worthy of ſuch Honour, which ſhall continue to their Poſterity: But ſometimes it ſo happeneth that many Perſons do claim the Title or Appellation of Gentleman, either from the Places they hold, or from ſome excellent Art or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they profeſs; as thoſe that ſtudy the Laws of the Land, or profeſs themſelves Maſters in the liberal Sciences: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if he can live without Manual labour, and bear the Port and Charge of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he ſhall not only be called ſo by others, but think himſelf ſo indeed: And any ſuch that hath not a true Pretence to a Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, may have one aſſigned them by the Appointment of the Heralds, whoſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity may enjoy the Title of <hi>Gentile.</hi> But to be more particular, we ſhall find this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to be ranked under nine Heads or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A Gentleman of Anceſtry, who is called a Gentleman of Bloud.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Gentleman of Bloud, and not of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtry; which is in the third Degree.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. A Gentleman of Coat-Armour, and not of Bloud, which is he that firſt beareth the King's Device, given him by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds: If he have Iſſue to the third deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, ſuch Iſſue is a Gentleman of Bloud, but none under.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A Gentleman of Armour not given him, as when the King giveth a Lordſhip to a Yeoman and his Heirs for ever: If the Family to whom the Lordſhip did belong be extinct, the Perſon ſo admitted may bear the Coat-Armour of the ſaid Lord, being Approved of by the Heralds; but if the Family be not extinct he cannot, only he ſhall be accounted a Gentleman, and may have a Coat appointed him by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If a Chriſtian Man, in the Service of God and his Prince, kills a Heathen Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, he ſhall bear his Coat-Armour (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſaid Heathen be a Knight Banne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,) and uſe the ſame Atchievement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difference, ſave only in the Word or Motto of the Infidel, and his Iſſue in the fifth Degree ſhall be a Gentleman of Bloud; but no Chriſtian Man can bear another Chriſtians Coat: Yet if an Engliſh Man in the Field, when the Banner royal is diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do put to flight, take Priſoner, or by Fire or Force ſlay any Gentleman enemy to his Prince, the Engliſh Man ſhall honour his

                     <p n="6">6. If the King make a Yeoman a Knight, he is called a Gentleman of Bloud.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A Yeoman's Son advanced to Spiritual dignity is a Gentleman, but not of Bloud, unleſs he arrive to be a Doctor of the Law, and then he ſhall be accounted a Gentleman of Bloud.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The eight is called a Gentleman Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryall, that is, one who being brought up in ſome Abby, or like Place, and related to the Abbat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth in time obtain prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſame Abby, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The <hi>Venetians,</hi> and <hi>Genoieſe,</hi> are great Merchants, and Traffickers: The <hi>Neopolitan,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtand ſo much upon their punctillios, that they ſcorn to exerciſe themſelves in any induſtrious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; but chuſe rather to live by Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Robbery; nay, the <hi>German</hi> will think it no ſhame nor diſhonour to enlarge his Eſtate by Robbery, which even in times of Peace they daily practiſe. The <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Egyptians, Perſians,</hi> and many others, count no Man worthy of Honour but their Soldiery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> keep too ſevere a a Hand over their poor Tenents, who are but their Vaſſals: Neither are the Engliſh Gentry without many and great Privileges peculiar to their Degree, of which theſe that follow are ſome. If a Churl defame a Gentleman, he hath a Remedy in Law <hi>(Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione injuriarum,)</hi> in equal Crimes a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall be puniſhed with more favour than a Churl; and if condemned to dye,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58589:50"/>he not to be hang'd, but to be beheaded, and to be examined without Torture. There are ceremonial Reſpects due to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which are not to others, in giving of evidence; a Gentleman's Teſtimony is to be preferred before a Clown's; in Elections of Magiſtrates and Officers by Vote, the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of a Gentleman ſhall take place; he is excuſed from baſe and ſervile Offices, and when choſen an Officer for two Citys, he may take his choice of either. Thoſe that are Noble are not to be put to their Oath, nor ſworn in Juries on Life and Death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Peers: A Clown may not challenge a Gentleman to Combat. In Marriages of Relations, or Guardians of Eſtates, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is to be entruſted, though there be nigher of Kin. A Gentleman becoming an Apprentice doth not loſe his Gentility, and much of the like. Thus have we run through all thoſe Orders and Degrees of Men, who are ſtyled Noble or Gentile, who have alſo more general Notes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, the better to diſtinguiſh their ſeveral Degrees, of which amongſt the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that of the Coronet is moſt eſpecial, which is mentioned under their ſeveral Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles above, and that of the Helmet exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it ſelf from the King to the private Gentleman; as, namely,</p>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58589:51"/>eſpecially in ſome Countries; and of thoſe it is that the Statutes mean, when they ſay, that none ſhall paſs in any Inqueſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they have Free-hold in yearly Revenue: And by theſe ſort of Men all Tryalls of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Country do ordinarily proceed, being Men accounted more apt to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and diſcern in doubtfull Caſes, than the ruder People, who are uſed to ſervile Labour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides, the Yeoman can better allow his time, having of his own; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there be that can expend above 200 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> living more gentile thereon, than ſome on greater Revenues. Another Reaſon (as ſome think) why theſe Men are choſen into Jurors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is becauſe the poorer ſort through need might be eaſily corrupted.</p>
                     <p>In old time the Yeomen were famous for Man-hood; for our Infantry, which have been ſo renowned for Archery through the world, (and that ſo often conquered the <hi>French,</hi>) were compoſed of Yeoman: They have many peculiar Previleges, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to no other Nation; as that no Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>England</hi> can be impriſoned, or ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his Eſtate, or Poſſeſſion, without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Law, and juſt cauſe firſt ſhewn: if he be impriſoned he cannot be denyed a <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas Corpus,</hi> and if no juſt cauſe be ſhewed, he is to be ſet at Liberty. No Soldier can be quartered upon a Free-man (unleſs it

Theſe and many other Freedoms make them moſt happy, and ſhould ingage them to be loyal to their Prince, under whoſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their Privileges are preſerved.</p>

And that he may the better know how to give a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Device, or Coat-Armour, he is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: Firſt, Whether he that would bear them deſire them, and honour Gentility,

Fourthly, Whether he be clean of Life, Juſt in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, cunning in all or any of the liberal Sciences, or hath knowledge in Divinity, or Philoſophy. Fifthly, Of whom he hath Praiſe of good Works done; whether they were Perſons of Reputation for Wiſdom, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.

                     <p>The Herald is likewiſe to be very expert in the betroathing of Princes; he is not to diſcloſe the ſecrets of Ladies, nor any other, not proper to be known, appertaining to their own Art; he is to be carefull in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Advice, and to acquaint the Bearer of Coat-Armour, that the end thereof is to adorn his Family, and to make him ſhew more excellent than others; and therefore not to doe any diſhonourable Actions: He muſt be alſo able to diſtinguiſh their Lines, and Iſſues, the better to doe right to the Perſon.</p>

                     <p>THis is a Field too large to be traced through in ſo ſmall a Volum as this, and therefore I cannot pretend to ſhew the Art of Blazon, but only (as well as I can
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58589:67"/>with ſuch Brevity,) give you the general Terms of Art, and Names of thoſe things which are particularly nominated in this Honourable Science.</p>
                     <p>Briefly therefore, Armory is an Art whereby we attain to the Knowledg of the uſe of Coat-Armour, which conſiſteth of two general Heads; firſt Blazoning, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Marſhaling.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Blazoning is the explication of Coat-Armour in ſuch ſignificant Terms, that the Vertues of the firſt Bearers may be known, and this is done by expreſſing what the Colours, Shapes, Kinds, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of thoſe things are which are born in Coat-Armour, with their Poſition; by which the true ſignification may be known.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Marſhalling is the orderly placings of ſeveral Coats, belonging (ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally) to divers Families within one Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coucheon, and the well diſpoſing of thoſe Ornaments which belong to them in their proper Places without the Eſtouchen. Of theſe in General.</p>
                     <p>More particular Arms are divided into things within the Eſcoucheon, and things without the Eſcoucheon, thoſe things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Eſcoucheon are the Mantling, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, (where due,) Torce, Helm, Creſt, Motto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But not to enlarge on theſe things, we ſhall chiefly ſpeak of thoſe things
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58589:67"/>within the Eſcoucheon. Firſt, The Eſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon muſt be ſpread over with ſome Metal, Colour, or Furr, which do admit of ſeveral Denominations, according to the quality of the Perſon to whom the Coat doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; if a King, or abſolute Prince, his Coat is blazoned, or expreſs'd by Planets; a Nobleman's by precious Stones, and thoſe of lower Ranks, by Colours; which take as under written:

                        <p>Beaſts of Prey are more honourable than Beaſts of Chaſe, and the more honourable the Beaſt is, the more honourable the Coat; the Male is more honourable than the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and thoſe that are gilt, or kerved, leſs honourable than thoſe that are not; the whole is better than the parts, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular poſture than the irregular; thoſe at liberty are better than thoſe that are not, by being chained, muzled, or the like: and the proper colour is better than different. Of parts; firſt the Head, if of a Beaſt of Prey, ſhews the firſt Bearer to head an Army, to be bold and ſtout; or to deſtroy or take ſome General of the Enemies. Next to Beaſts of Prey are the Unicorn, Horſe, Bull, Ram, Goat, Hart, &amp;c. all whoſe Heads are honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable according to their ſeveral Degrees. Next the Head are the Gambs or Paws, and then the Lions Tails. A Limb or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber either of Man, Beaſt, or Fowl, is better eraſed than couped, and that better than caboſed; nor are Monſters ſo honourable as thoſe of true ſhapes. The nearer any Coat
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58589:73"/>is to the King's Coat in whoſe Countrey he lives, the more honourable is that Coat.</p>
                        <p>The Lion ſhews great Power, Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Mercy, and all other generous Vertues.</p>
                        <p>The Unicorn one of Strength and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, who will fight it out to the laſt, and never yield; yet withall ready to doe good to his Enemies: It hath ſignifications of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The Wolf ſhews one who hath Power and Parts to aſſemble many together, and might firſt be given to him that brought a Band of his Tenents, Friends, or Voluntiers, to the King's Service.</p>
                        <p>The Fox ſignifies one that by Policy and Strategeme hath gotten poſſeſſion of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Quarters, or Countrey.</p>
                        <p>The Horſe ſhews one bold and valiant, and a Perſon that by his Example encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth others: It alſo ſheweth, that the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer might have mounted his General or Prince in Battel.</p>

                        <p>The Boar is given to thoſe that are vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, but not liberal, and one that will dye nobly rather than flie baſely.</p>
                        <p>The Hedghog ſhews one that is expert in gathering Riches, and prudent in laying hold on all opportunities to ſecure them.</p>
                        <p>The Coney ſhews a Perſon to be a skilfull Pionier, and ſucceſsfull; alſo good in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Trenches.</p>

                        <p>The Camel one that is ready and ſpeedy in buſineſs.</p>
                        <p>The Bear ſhews one politick and valiant, though perhaps greedy of Gain.</p>
                        <p>The Ape may perhaps be given to one who firſt pleaſed his Prince by his pleaſant and facetious Humour; and alſo ſhews one
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58589:74"/>very apt to learn by Inſpection, and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                        <p>The Hart ſheweth one carefully politick, who foreſeeing the Danger, prevents it, making good his own Party, and circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Enemies.</p>
                        <p>Monſtrous Beaſts are leſs honourable than others, and ſhew that the firſt Bearers might have ſomething in them which was vitious; which though it did not wholly outvie their Vertues, yet it might be a blemiſh to the ſame, and ſhews oftentimes Illegitimacy.</p>
                        <p>The Leopard ſhews a ſubtile man, one that would ſurprize his Enemies by Policy where his Strength faileth; yet withall too violent when he hath overcome.</p>
                        <p>The Griffin ſhews one valiant, and to make great ſpoil of his Enemies Megazines, yet cruel and covetous.</p>
                        <p>The Dragon or Wivorn ſhews one that invades his Enemies, not in a main Battel, but as a Privatier, or one who hath Letters of Mart, and ſubdueth Pirates, or the like, and will be ſure to keep faſt what he gets, though unjuſtly.</p>
                        <p>The Mantiger ſhews one to have ſhewed himſelf moſt humane and courteous to all, and withall courageous, yet in his Conqueſts too much of a cruel Tyrant.</p>
                        <p>The Sphinx and Harpie the ſame.</p>
                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:58589:75"/>
                        <p>The Bat or Reremous ſhews a low begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but by care and induſtry to arrive to great Wealth, and thereby to Honour, yet ſneaking, and of a low Spirit.</p>
                        <p>The Poſtures of Beaſts are differently bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoned, according to the nature of them; for all Beaſts of Prey, or Battel, have one denomination for their poſture, and thoſe of Chaſe, or the like, have another.</p>
                        <p>Beaſts of Prey and Battel are couchant, paſſant, guardant, combatant, rampant, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, regardant, coward, double quere, quere inflected, quere renowned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beaſts of Chaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſaid to be lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tripant, at gaze, reſpecting, mounting, ſpringing, and the like.</p>
                        <p>Dormant, ſeiant, endorced, and ſome others, are common to both.</p>
                        <p>The Lion dormant ſhews a Perſon, who, having been victorious, gives over the War, and takes his Eaſe.</p>
                        <p>Couchant ſhews the ſame, but more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; one who hath given over publick Affairs.</p>
                        <p>Paſſant ſhews one ready for noble Actions, and one of abſolute Juriſdiction.</p>
                        <p>Seiant ſhews the Bearer to be one placed in ſome Frontier Gariſon; a wary, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Perſon.</p>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:58589:75"/>
                        <p>Guardant ſhews a Perſon of a vigilant Diſpoſition, who ſtands upon his Guard in the midſt of his Enemies.</p>
                        <p>Saliant ſhews the firſt Bearer to be a ready and active Perſon on all occaſions for War.</p>
                        <p>Rampant ſhews a Perſon truly valorous.</p>
                        <p>Regardant, coward, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhews the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to have been moſt worthy Perſons, but overcome and ſubdued by ſome conquering Prince.</p>
                        <p>Note generally, 1ſt. That oftentimes the bearing of Beaſts ſhew the Bearer to have ſubdued an Enemy of the ſame nature, and the Heads ſhew the ſame more properly.</p>
                        <p>Note 2dly, That whereas in the firſt of <hi>Edward</hi> II. and in the ſeventh of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. men that had Lands to the value of 20 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> were compelled to take upon them the Order of Knighthood, and though the Heralds were carefull to keep out baſe born People, who had grown rich, yet many were admitted who were but of very mean Extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whence many Devices were given them which in enigmatical Signs ſhewed the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the firſt Bearer, which is not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient here to name; and though none recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Arms for his Vices, but for his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, or Eſtate, as in thoſe Kings Reigns, and ſome ſince, yet thoſe Perſons having Vices which were known, and blemiſhed their
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58589:76"/>other Qualities, the Heralds would and were to take notice of the ſame, as above, in Monſters, in all irregular poſtures, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more.</p>
                        <p>Note 3dly, Many received Coats from their Names; becauſe their other Vertues, beſides their Eſtates, were not known; and ſome have received their Sirnames, and Coat of Arms both, from ſome quality they have been endowed with; wherefore it is that ſometimes the bearing of Coat Armour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Name, is both ancient and honourable.

                        <p>The Beſſant ſhews great profit brought by the Bearer to the King and Countrey.</p>

                        <p>The Tortuaux ſhews the firſt Bearer to be a Prieſt, or religious Perſon, or one that had done much for the Church.</p>
                        <p>The Hurt ſhews one who had received much hurt by his Enemies, but not to woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. <hi>Guillium</hi> calls them Whorts, or, as ſome call them, Whortle-berries. <hi>Leigh</hi> calls them Hurts, or Bruiſes in the Fleſh, which look blew; but he ſaith in Women they are called Tongue-Moles.</p>

                        <p>The ſecond thing which is of one ſhape, but diſtinguiſhed by the Colour, are Drops, therefore called Gutta; as,</p>

                        <p>When White, or Silver, then they are called Gutta de Eau, or Water, or Gutta de Argent, drops of Silver, but not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

                        <p>Again, there is the Fucil, which hath four Corners, but the diſtance between the upper corner and the lower is much more than that between the ſides. It is much like a quarril of Glaſs, and called by Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians Rhombus.</p>
                        <p>The Lozenge alſo, which is of the ſame form, but not ſo long, and ſomething broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, the Maſcle, which is juſt ſquare, ſtanding alſo cornerwiſe, but all open, or hollow within.</p>

                        <p>The Maſcle for the Meſhes of a Net.</p>
                        <p>The Fucil may ſhew the Bearer to have more Honour by the Mother-ſide than the Father's, or elſe, that their Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſprang from the beneficial Emploiment of Weaving or Cloathing, and many Engliſh Armoriſts blazon them Weavers Shuttles.</p>
                        <p>The Lozenge argues the firſt Bearer to be famous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the ſtudy or practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.</p>
                        <p>The Maſcle ſhews one who was very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and could inveagle and circumvent his Enemies; as alſo one who had advanced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by induſtry in Fiſhing.</p>
                        <p>There is alſo the Billit, which are Letters folded up more long than broad, and ſhews the Bearer to be employed in Embaſſies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Charge, ſome being charged.</p>
                        <p>The Steel Gad is much like the Billit, but bends a little out on one ſide, and in on the other; it is an argument of great Strength, but of much paſſion when provoked.</p>

                        <p>The Delft is exactly ſquare, it is a Delve or Spit of Earth, and is good bearing when the Colour is not of the Stainant Colours, but then it is a Blot; elſe it may ſignifie one that got Riches by gardening, or the like Occupation; alſo one who behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well in working of Trenches.</p>
                        <p>It would fill a very large Volume to ſpeak of all the ſeveral things born in Coat-Armour, if they could be all known; and therefore I hope theſe may be taken in good part, being already gone farther than at firſt I intended.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58589:82"/>call a Blot in their Eſcoucheon: Of theſe Armoriſts reckon nine, which are ever made of one of the Stainant Colours, <hi>viz.</hi> Tenne or Sanguin; elſe it's poſſible that ſome of them may be Arguments of Honour as in the Delft, Guſſet, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is the <hi>Delft;</hi> it is ſet in the middle of the Eſcoucheon, elſe it is not a Blot, (it muſt ſtand on one of its ſides,) and is given to one that revoketh his Challenge; as if dirt were thrown in his face.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is an <hi>Ineſcoucheon</hi> reverſt, which is a ſmall Eſcoucheon turn'd up ſide down in the middle of the Eſcoucheon. This is due to him that diſcourtiouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth Maid, or Widow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt her Will; and alſo for him that flyeth from his Sovereign's Banner.</p>
                     <p>The Third is called a <hi>Point,</hi> parted <hi>Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi> that is; when the upper right corner of the Eſcoucheon is parted from the whole, and is given to him, who boaſteth too much of his Deeds in War.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth is <hi>Point in Point,</hi> which conſiſteth of two arched Lines, and the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ends are joined in the middle of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoucheon, and ſo both paſs circularly to the ſides near the Bottom, thereby cutting off as it were a great part of the Eſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58589:83"/>at the lower part; and is given to one that is unwilling to fight.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth is called a <hi>Point Champane;</hi> it is made of one hollow arched Line, which as it were cuts off, or hideth the bottom of the Eſcoucheon, but more at each ſide than in the middle: It is given to him that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his Priſoner in cold Bloud, and when he may as well ſave him alive.</p>
                     <p>The Sixth is called a <hi>Plain Point,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bottom of the Eſcoucheon ſeems to be covered by a ſtreight Line, drawn from ſide to ſide; and is proper for him that inventeth falſe News, or Lies to his Prince; poſſibly the late French Ambaſſadour ought to be ſo ſerved.</p>
                     <p>The Seventh is called a <hi>Gore;</hi> it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of two hollow Lines, one whereof begins at the upper left Corner, or Siniſter Chief of the Eſcoucheon, and the other at the middle of the Bottom or Baſe Point, and ſo meet in the middle. It's proper for him that's a Coward, or Feminine-hearted.</p>
                     <p>The Eighth is called a <hi>Guſſet;</hi> it is made by drawing a Line a little ſloping from the upper corner of the Eſcoucheon, about one third of the Breadth, and then letting it fall perpendicular to the Bottom; it is given on the right ſide, to ſhew the Bearer one, who to ſatisfie his luſt neglects his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58589:83"/>Battel, and on the left ſide to him that neglects through Drunkenneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Ninth, and laſt, is when the whole Coat is reverſed, or turned upſide down and is proper for a Traytor; and muſt be blazoned by expreſſing the Colours to their common Names, as Yallow, White, Red, Light-Blew, Black, and the like, and not <hi>Or, Argent, Gules, Azure,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>I Conclude with naming thoſe places in the Eſcoucheon, which in Heraldry are called Points, and by which you are to know the ſeveral parts and places in it, which are alſo Nine. You are to imagine the Eſcoucheon, as placed before you, to be worn by the bearer; ſo that the right ſide of it anſwers to your left hand, and the left ſide to your right hand, and therefore are called the Dexter and Siniſter ſides of the Eſcoucheon. The Points are as follow: 1. The middle or centre of the Eſcoucheon is called the Feſs Point. 2. The middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Feſs point and the top of the Eſcoucheon, is called the Honour Point. 3. The right corner at the top is the Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre Chief Point. 4. The very middle of the top is the Chief Point. 5. The left cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the top is called the Siniſter Chief Point. 6.
